1. It is important to choose a license so you can specify what can be done with your code. Without a license it defaults to all rights reserved and may prevent your code from being adopted or contributed to.

2. While contributing to a project it is important to make sure there is a license. This is because you want to know that you will have access to the code that you are putting work into. You want to be able to keep access to your contributions if you are doing this for free on your own time. You don't want to contribute to something that may be yanked out from under you.

3. Overall they attribute the failure to gopher on the fact that they didn't support hypertext. They believe it was overtaken because the other project was open source and had more mind power behind it. This allowed them to better implement stuff people were waiting for.

4. The linux kernel choose to use the gpl v2 due to it being copyleft. This allows them to make people using their code contribute their changes allowing them to progress very fast and build up a code base. "but I love GPLv2. I really think the license has been one of the defining factors in the success of Linux because it enforced that you have to give back, which meant that the fragmentation has never been something that has been viable from a technical standpoint."

5. I believe businesses tend to lean towards apache due to them being able to more readily commercially viable and allow more freedoms with additional code build on top. LGPL is more suited for a developer because it allows dynamic linking to your libraries, such as something like the qt framework. GPL is best for the common good because it allow all the code written towards a project to be public and if it fixes issues or adds features it can be merged in.

6. A project I have become interested in is a gdb plugin called gef. The demographic is security engineers and people debugging programs. This aims to make gdb more usable for other things then very specific debugging. Right now it is licensed under MIT license which is good as its very permissive and allows my work to be open. I generally lean towards 2 clause bsd, but for no particular reason besides its a license I liked when I first needed to add a license to a project so i understand it the most.
